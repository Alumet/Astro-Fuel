# THE CHALLENGE: ASTEROID MINING

Develop an approach for characterizing the composition of asteroid for mining potential and a process for mining different compositions. Explore a possible division of labor involving different types of vehicles (e.g. sensor units, drilling units, power gathering and distribution, extracted resources handling and transferring). Consider solutions for moving said asteroids between different orbits and/or consequently make periodical adjustments to keep them in place. Analyze how your idea would cope in some of the given scenarios or outline a scheme of your own.

# EXPLANATION

Fuel transport in earth-launched spacecrafts is a significant barrier in the development of a full-blown space industry. In this context, being able to access readily available fuel, right outside Earth's doorstep, would be a radical game changer.

Drawing from years of research from industry players and scientific organizations, we believe that this idea could be made a reality by extracting water from asteroids' surfaces. We propose a mission plan to identify and characterize asteroids in terms of potential water yield, extract and recover liquid water from the superficial materials, and finally stockpile and transform the extracted water into liquid oxygen & liquid hydrogen. Having the processed fuel in the upper LEO would thus allow easy access for outbound spacecrafts to refuel.
