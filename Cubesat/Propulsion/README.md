#Propulsions Systems

For this specific mission, two propulsion systems were considered. One using solar sail technology, and another using Busek BIT-3 RF ion Thruster 

###Cube sat specification

-	5.7kg mass excluding propellant
-	48W solar panel array

##Solar sail system

Solar sail propulsion systems provide very weak instantaneous propulsion. Over extended periods of acceleration time however, this technology turns out to be highly efficient. For this project, we consider Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency IKAROS' mission scientific results. On this specific experiment, average radiation pressure was 6,47E-06 N/m2. 
From these results, we can compute the  time required to obtain the target Delta-V required to rendezvous with the target asteroid.

Our results showthat the required mission time tends to be very long if the solar sails are kept at a reasonable size (30 m2). Acceleration time will range from 5 years (aiming for 3km/s Delta-V) to 9 years (aiming for 5km/s Delta-V).

##Busek BIT-3 RF Ion Thruster

####Thruster specifications with 48W solar panels array & Iodine
-	Thrust = 1mN
-	Isp = 2500s

Considering the Busek BIT-3 RF ion thruster, 1.3 kg of iodine propellant is required for a 5km/s Delta-V budget. Mission time is also drastically reduced compared to solar sail propulsion, with an acceleration time of 70 days instead of 9 years. 
 
#Conclusion
Taking into consideration all our results,  the better propulsion alternative for our objectives is the Busek BIT-3 RF Ion Thruster, given our specific mission parameters.
